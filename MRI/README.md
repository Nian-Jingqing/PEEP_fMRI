# PEEP

This collection of functions construct the behavioural experiment 
Pain-Expectation-Exrecise-Pressure. 

We incorporated a pressure cuff () to induce pain 
as well as a fitness bike by Wahoo (KICKR Bike) to induce exercise. 

The functions are divided according to their purpose - calibration, CPAR, experiment
and utils.
